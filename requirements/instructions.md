### Project Overview
This project is a Task Manager Application built using Next.js 14, Shadcn, and Tailwind CSS. The app is designed to help users manage their tasks by organizing them into three categories:

Not Started
Ongoing
Completed
Each task consists of a title, description, due date, and a unique ID. The application includes drag-and-drop functionality for seamless task movement between categories and a calendar that displays tasks based on their due dates.

### Feature Requirements
1. Drag-and-Drop Functionality
Tasks (represented as cards) can be dragged from one category to another.
Ensure tasks move smoothly between Not Started, Ongoing, and Completed columns.
2. Calendar View
Display tasks on their respective due dates.
The calendar should show Task ID and Title for each task on the respective date.
